# V8 JavaScript Engine Wiki #

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine.

V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google.

V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in [ECMA-262](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), 5th edition, and runs on Windows (XP or newer), Mac OS X (10.5 or newer), and Linux systems that use IA-32, x64, or ARM processors.

V8 can run standalone, or can be [embedded](https://developers.google.com/v8/embed) into any C++ application.

You can find more information here:
